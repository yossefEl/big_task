# Big Selenium Project
This is a big project that uses Selenium to automate the process according to the checklist provided by the Professor. The project is divided into 2 parts:

| **Send a form**                                      | Automate the process of submitting a general form (like feedback or settings).         |
| **Static Page test**                                 | Check the load and display of static pages like the homepage or documentation.         |
| **Multiple page test from array**                    | Automate visiting multiple static pages using an array of URLs to check each page.    |
| **Complex xpath**                                    | Use a complex XPath to locate elements like links within nested divs.                  |
| **Filling or reading textarea content**              | Automate entering or verifying text in a textarea field, like a model description.    |
| **Filling or reading drop-down**                     | Automate selecting options from a drop-down menu, such as sorting options in search.  |
| **Filling or reading Radio button**                  | Automate checking a radio button, such as selecting a subscription plan.               |
| **At least 4 class, 6 class, 8 class**               | Check the presence and correctness of CSS classes on the page elements.               |
| **Explicit wait**                                    | Implement waits to ensure elements are loaded before actions are taken.               |

| **BasePage object class**                            | Create a base class for common page properties and methods used across tests.         |
| **Test suite looks like readable test description**  | Structure your test suite so that the tests read like a clear description of actions. |

| **E-mail checking**                                    | Test the email sending and receiving process, like account activation emails.         |
| **Test with random data**                              | Use randomly generated data in tests to ensure robustness.                            |
